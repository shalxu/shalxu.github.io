    Since moving to Moscow last summer,we were both amazed and content with the offerings of this small town (or big city according to Hugh). If you are thinking about travelling to Moscow, what other places can you also visit during the trip? Here are some places that we have really enjoyed, and we hope you will enjoy them too!

    <br/>Moscow Summer Highlights:
    <br/>
    <br/> There is this unusual landscape in the palouse called Rolling Hills!

    <div class="lime-green">Moscow Farmer's Market (every Saturday 8am -1pm):</div>
    You wouldn't expect a tiny town like Moscow to have such a big fancy farmer's market.There are always lots of live musicians, bakeries, caterers, art works, handcrafts, local farmers, and much more. We highly recommend the white nectarines, donut peaches and rainier cherries from local farmers!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="lime-green">Moscow Art Walk:</div>
    Artworks from local artists are displayed throughout many businesses in Moscow, ID.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="lime-green">University of Idaho Arboretum and Botanical Garden:</div>
    Sits in a scenic location right next to the Idaho rolling hills. A great variety of plants. Takes about 1.5 hours for a full-round lovely walk.
