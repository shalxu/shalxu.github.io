Q: Where is the wedding registry? 
A: We already have enough plates, cups, silverware etc., therefore we won’t be having a wedding registry. You are not obligated to bring anything, other than an empty stomach (recommend skipping breakfast). If you have a specific gift that you really want to bring, you may. If you are still haunted by guilt, you can also bring a Chinese-styled “red packet” with cash.
