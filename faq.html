    <br/>
    <div class="lime-green">Q: Where would the wedding be? </div>
    A: The wedding will be at our recently purchased house, at the top of the hill after a little hike (we recommend wearing some comfortable walking shoes!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="lime-green">Q: Is RSVP required? </div>
    A: Yes yes yes! We can't determine how much Chinese food and dessert to order, or notify you of wedding updates, without your RSVP. Also please remember to fill out your information on animal and food allergies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="lime-green">Q: What will the wedding be like? </div>
    A: This wedding is to make the official announcement to our close friends and family. It will be tiny, short, but with a LOT of food (bring your empty stomach). We will serve a full Chinese food buffet.
    <br/>
    <br/> Our beloved Laborador puppy Buttermilk will also attend the wedding (she will be so excited to meet you!)
    <br/>
    <br/> The wedding will be held outdoors. Since we won't have a photographer, you are welcome to take pictures and share with us :)

    <br/>
    <div class="lime-green">Q: Should family/spouse come?</div>
    A: Yes if they like Chinese food! The more people the merrier.
    <br/> Even friendly dogs are welcome to give Buttermilk company. We have dog food and water, just remember to bring a leash.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="lime-green">Q: What’s the dress code? </div>
    A: None! You are welcome to dress formal, but remember the wedding will be outdoors on grass. For comfort's sake, the bride will not be wearing high heels.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="lime-green">Q: Where is the wedding registry? </div>
    A: We already have enough plates, cups, silverware etc.. Therefore, we won’t be having a wedding registry. You are not obligated to bring anything, other than an empty stomach. If you have a specific gift that you really want to bring, you are welcome to.
